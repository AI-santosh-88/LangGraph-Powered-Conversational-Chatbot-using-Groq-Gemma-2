üìå Project Title:
LangGraph-Powered Conversational Chatbot using Groq + Gemma 2

üè¢ Business Use Case:
Conversational AI for High-Speed, Low-Latency Responses Using Groq LLMs
Businesses can use this chatbot for real-time customer service, internal automation, sales assistance, or domain-specific tasks like tech support, HR onboarding, or financial consultations ‚Äî all powered by a lightning-fast Groq backend.

üßæ Project Description:
This project demonstrates how to build a stateful, streaming-capable chatbot using the LangGraph framework (part of the LangChain ecosystem), integrated with the Groq API running the Gemma-2-9B-Instruct model. It uses a simple state management approach, invoking the model with updated messages and allowing for seamless, interactive chat sessions.
The project allows users to communicate with an AI assistant, with real-time message handling, and structured graph-based processing of conversational state.


üßë‚Äçüíª Key Responsibilities/Functional Flow:

1.User Input Handling: Captures and processes user input in a loop.

2.Graph Construction: Uses StateGraph to define and manage a simple two-node graph (START -> chatbot -> END).

3.Message Augmentation: Leverages add_messages to track conversational history.

4.LLM Invocation: Uses ChatGroq to send the conversation state to the Gemma 2 model and get the AI's response.

5.Streaming Output: Streams back AI responses in real-time using graph.stream(...).

6.Session Termination: Allows graceful exit using "quit" or "q".



üì¶ Python Packages Used:

Package	                        Purpose

langchain            -	        Core language model interface

langgraph	           -          Graph-based workflow engine for LLM applications

langsmith            -          (Optional) Observability, tracing, analytics

langchain_groq	     -          Connects LangChain to Groq-hosted LLMs
